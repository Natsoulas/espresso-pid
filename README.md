# Espresso Machine PID Temperature Control Code

This README provides an overview of code that demonstrates a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) temperature control system. The code is designed to control the temperature of a Rancilio Silvia espresso machine such that it reaches and maintain a setpoint temperature using PID control.

## Code Overview

The code snippet contains pseudocode for a basic implementation of a PID controller for temperature regulation. It includes the following components:

### PID Controller Parameters

- `Kp`: The Proportional gain. Adjusts the immediate response to the error between the setpoint and the current temperature.
- `Ki`: The Integral gain. Adjusts the response to the accumulation of past errors over time.
- `Kd`: The Derivative gain. Adjusts the response based on the rate of change of the error.

### Control Variables

- `setpoint`: The desired temperature (in degrees Celsius) that the system should reach and maintain.
- `previous_error`: The previous error value, used for calculating the derivative term.
- `integral`: The integral term, which accumulates past errors.

### Main PID Loop

The main loop runs continuously and performs the following actions:

1. Read the current temperature from a thermocouple (simulated by a static value in the code).
2. Calculate the error as the difference between the setpoint temperature and the current temperature.
3. Calculate the integral term by accumulating the error over time.
4. Calculate the derivative term as the difference between the current error and the previous error.
5. Compute the control output using the PID equation: `output = Kp * error + Ki * integral + Kd * derivative`.
6. Limit the control output to a certain range to avoid saturation. In this code, it's limited between 0 and 3.3 volts.
7. Update the previous error for the next iteration.
8. Add a time delay of 0.01 seconds using the `time.sleep` or `usleep` function to set the sampling time for the controller.

### Control Output

The code caps the control output by determining whether the output is above 3.3V or not. The microcontroller in use can only output 3.3V so the cap is set there to avoid saturation. Another thing to note is that the activation voltage of the Solid State Relay in use is 3V.

## Usage

This code serves as a basic example of a PID controller for temperature control. To adapt it for your specific application, you will need to replace the constant input thermocouple reading with actual temperature data and ensure that the control output interfaces with your heating element or system as required.

## Disclaimer

This code is in development and should not be used for real-world temperature control without proper testing, calibration, and safety considerations. Temperature control systems can be critical, and any implementation should be thoroughly validated and tested to ensure safe and reliable operation.
